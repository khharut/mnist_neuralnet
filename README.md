Different approaches to solve MNIST problem with convolutional neural networks

mnist_nn.py: neural network with 'keras' and 'tensorflow' libraries to solve the problem

mnist_nn.wls: neural network code for Wolfram Mathematica 12

mnist_nn.R: convolutional neural network code for R, the model is the same as for python
